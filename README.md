# Simple ERC-20 Token Contract

This repository contains a simple implementation of an ERC-20 token contract written in Solidity. The ERC-20 token standard is widely used for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a basic understanding of how ERC-20 tokens work and how to create a simple token contract using Solidity.

The contract in this repository implements the following functionalities:

- Minting new tokens
- Transferring tokens between accounts
- Approving and transferring tokens on behalf of another account

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/elio-bteich/erc20-token.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd erc20-token
```


3. Explore the \`ERC20Token.sol\` file to understand the contract's structure and functions.

4. To deploy and interact with the contract, you can use tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle).

## Contract Details

- **Name:** SimpleERC20Token
- **Symbol:** SET
- **Decimals:** 18 (adjustable)
- **Total Supply:** Initially 0 (can be minted by the contract owner)

## Key Functions

- \`totalSupply()\`: Returns the total supply of tokens.
- \`balanceOf(address account)\`: Returns the token balance of a specified account.
- \`mint(uint256 amount)\`: Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens.
- \`transfer(address to, uint256 amount)\`: Allows an account to transfer tokens to another account.
- \`allowance(address owner, address spender)\`: Returns the allowed token amount for a spender.
- \`approve(address spender, uint256 amount)\`: Approves a spender to transfer a specific amount of tokens.
- \`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)\`: Allows a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of an owner.

## Security Considerations

- Always be cautious when interacting with smart contracts. Ensure you understand the contract's behavior before sending transactions.
- Follow best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities such as integer overflow/underflow.
